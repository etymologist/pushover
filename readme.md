### Overview

This is just a basic linux/unix script that when placed in the right place, can trigger a mobile or desktop pushover alert.

#### Requirements

You'll need to register your application and sign up for a [Pushover API key](https://pushover.net/api) (no charge).

#### Usage

If you intend to use it for server reboots, place the script in the `/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/` directory and make it executable.
